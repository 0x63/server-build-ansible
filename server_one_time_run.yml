# this playbook gets run once and only once for each new server.
# it assumes the server has one user account with root privilges

# only changes made to server: (1) gave static ip address (2) install openssh-server 
# if getting ssh errors during re-build using diff host with same ip address:
# ssh-keygen -f "/home/cisco/.ssh/known_hosts" -R 192.168.1.53
# if you use the dhcp ip to push the first few playbooks, don't forget to create add a new host file
